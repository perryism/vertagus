Vertagus
========

Vertagus is a tool to enable automation around maintining versions for your source code via a source control
management's tag feature.

Installation
------------

To install vertagus, clone it and then pip install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdraines/vertagus.git
pip install ./vertagus
```

Assumptions
-----------

Vertagus assumes some things about your development and versioning process:

- You are using some sort of packaging or distribution tool that contains a structured text document like `yaml` or 
  `toml`, and you declare your package version in that document. Vertagus calls these documents "manifests".
- You are using a source control manager (scm) like [git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage your code's changes.
- You would like to use your scm's tag feature to track versions. So, for example, if your package version is
  `1.0.2` currently, you'd like your scm to tag this point in your code's history with something like `1.0.2` (thogh you 
  can customize the format some.)

What it does
------------

### Configuration

Vertagus lets you declare some things about how you'd like to maintain your versioning:

- **Manifests**, which are the source of truth for your versioning. (You can declare more than one if you like, but the
  first one will be considered the authoritative version.)
- **Rules** that your versioning should follow. For example, should it match a certain regex pattern? Should it always
  be incrementally higher than the last version? Is your version required to be in multiple manifests, and you need to
  know if they are out of sync with each other?
- **Version Aliases** whose tags can move around a bit. For example, you might use major-minor-patch semantic
  versioning, but you'd like to maintain a major-minor alias on whatever your most recent patch version is.
- **Stages** of your development process that might need different rules or aliases. This might correspond to names like
  `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`, or it could be whatever else you like, depending on how you plan to use it.
- **Tag Prefixes** in case you're developing in a repository that holds multiple packages. Or maybe you just like 
  prefixes.

You declare these in a `vertagus.toml` file next to your package in your repository.

### Command Line Interface

Vertagus provides two main operations in its `vertagus` CLI:

#### `validate`

The `validate` command looks like this:

```
vertagus validate [--stage-name STAGE_NAME --file CONFIG_FILEPATH]
```

The `validate` command will check your configuration and run any rules that you have declared there. If any of the rules
are being broken by the current state of the code, then it will exit with exit code 1. Otherwise, it exits without
error.

#### `create-tag`

The `create-tag` command looks like this:

```
vertagus create-tag [--stage-name STAGE_NAME --file CONFIG_FILEPATH]
```

The `create-tag` command will check your configuration and create tags for the current version of your code as well as
for any aliases that may be declared. These tags are created locally, but then pushed to your remote.

### Continuous Integration

You may have noticed that the operations described above are a little odd to run just anywhere any time. Vertagus is
best suited to be executed in CI automation. For example, you could configure your scm platform to run the `validate`
command when a pull request is created as a check that must pass in order to merge. Then, you could configure your
scm platform to run the `create-tag` command after a pull request has merged and closed.
